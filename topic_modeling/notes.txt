slda accepts a label file and a data file.  Some documents may actually have multiple lables assocaited with it.
For those docs, copy the document summary for each label and treat it as a seaprate entry:

[l1,l2,l3] [d]-> [l1 d][l2 d][l3 d]

Where d is the document and l1, l2, l3 are the labels (categories) for the document


Check out the readme.txt in the slda folder:

Doc format:
    [M] [term_1]:[count] [term_2]:[count] ...  [term_N]:[count]

Label file format:
    The labels must be 0, 1, ..., C-1, if we have C classes.


Full text:
    Data format

    (1) [data] is a file where each line is of the form:

         [M] [term_1]:[count] [term_2]:[count] ...  [term_N]:[count]

    where [M] is the number of unique terms in the document, and the
    [count] associated with each term is how many times that term appeared
    in the document. 

    (2) [label] is a file where each line is the corresponding label for [data].
    The labels must be 0, 1, ..., C-1, if we have C classes.
